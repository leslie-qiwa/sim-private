# sim-private
This repo is to simulate one private repo. 10 committs will be created.

2nd companion repo will simulate public repo as another companies's upstream repo. 

Below is the workflow to verify:
1. Alice shallow clone this private repo and takes 5 commits
2. Alice push the shallown clone repo to 2nd repo
3. Bob fork 2nd repo, and pushed his change to his own fork
